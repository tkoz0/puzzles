1. Draw light bulbs (represented by circles) in the grid according to the
following rules.
2. Light bulbs may be placecd in any white cell. A numbered cell indicates how
many light bulbs are horizontally or vertically adjacent to it.
3. Each light bulb illuminates every cell in its row and column until its light
is blocked by a black cell or the edge of the grid.
4. Every white cell must be illuminated, and a light bulb cannot illuminate
another light bulb.

White cell: space
Black cell: # for non numbered, 1,2,3,4 for numbered

1. Divide the grid into regions and fill in all empty cells with numbers
according to the following rules.
2. Each region must be completely filled with the same number. The number that a
region is filled with must be equal to the number of cells in that region.
3. Regions of the same size may not touch along an edge. (They may touch at a
corner.)

Numbered cell: digit
Empty cell: space

1. Connect the numbered islands with bridges (represented by lines) so that the
number on each island is equal to the number of bridges that connect to it.
2. Two islands may never be connected by more than two bridges.
3. Bridges may not cross islands or other bridges.
4. All bridges must be connected. (That is, it must be possible to reach any
island from any other island by traveling on the network of bridges.)

1. The grid is divided into rectangular "rooms." Shade in some cells of the grid
according to the following rules.
2. Rooms with numbers indicate how many shaded cells are in that room.
3. A line of white cells may not pass through more than two rooms. (For
instance, if the black cell in the bottom row were white instead, there would be
a row of white cells passing through four rooms.)
4. Shaded cells may not be horizontally or vertically adjacent to each other,
and all white cells must remain connected. (For instance, if the black cell in
the bottom row were moved one cell to the right, it would cut off the white area
in the lower right from the rest of the grid.)

1. Shade in four connected cells (that is, a tetromino) in each outlined region.
2. Four shapes of tetromino are used: L, I, T, and S. Identical shapes may not
touch along an edge. (They may touch at a corner.) Shapes with the same letter
are identical, no matter how they are reflected or rotated.
3. The shaded cells must all be connected to each other.
4. No 2x2 square of cells may be entirely shaded.

1. Draw a path, traveling horizontally and vertically, that forms a complete
loop. The path may never cross itself or pass through the same cell twice.
2. The path must pass through every cell containing a black or white circle.
3. The path must go straight when passing through a white circle, and must make
a 90-degree turn in at least one of the cells immediately before or after the
white circle in the path.
4. The path must make a 90-degree turn when passing through a black circle, and
must go straight through both cells immediately before and after the black
circle in the path.

1. Shade in cells to make a "river" of black cells according to the following
rules.
2. Numbered cells may not be shaded in.
3. Each numbered cell is part of an "island" of white cells; the number
indicates how many cells are part of that island. Each island contains exactly
one number.
4. The black cells must form a single continuous region.
5. No 2x2 square of cells may be entirely shaded black.

1. Shade in some cells with black triangles according to the following rules.
2. Triangles may be placed (in white cells only) in one of four orientations:
+--+ +--+ +--+ +--+
|\ | |#/| |\#| | /|
|#\| |/ | | \| |/#|
+--+ +--+ +--+ +--+
3. The parts of the grid that remain white (uncovered by black triangles) must
always form a rectangle.
4. A numbered cell indicates how many black triangles are horizontally and
vertically adjacent to it.

For this ASCII art, each 2x2 area represents a cell
Number filled cells are the provided numbered black cells
The other notwhite cells are filled in with one of the triangle orientations

1. Connect adjacent dots with horizontal and vertical lines to make a complete
loop that never crosses or touches itself.
2. A numbered cell indicates how many lines surround it; empty cells may be
surrounded by any number of lines.

Provided numbers are the digits in the center of 4 dots on the grid
The solution path is represented by - and | connecting the dots

1. Draw a path, traveling horizontally and vertically, that forms a complete
loop. The path may never cross itself or pass through the same cell twice.
2. The path must pass  straight through each "gate" (dotted line) exactly once.
3. The path starts from the circled number and returns to it after passing
through all the gates. The number in the circle indicates the total number of
gates.
4. A numbered gate indicates the order in which the gate must be passed through.
For example, a gate labeled "1" must be the first gate passed through (in either
direction) from the circled number. A gate with no number may be crossed at any
point.

Left: # are black cells, - and | indicate gates, the numbers adjacent to gates
should also have arrows pointing toward the gate, the X is the starting number,
in this case the X represents the circled 4

1. Shade some cells and draw a path, traveling horizontally and vertically, that
forms a complete loop. The path may never cross itself or pass through the same
cell twice.
2. Numbered cells indicate how many shaded cells there are between the cell and
the edge of the grid, in the direction of the arrow.
3. Shaded cells may not be horizontally or vertically adjacent to each other.
4. The path must pass through every cell that isn't shaded in or numbered.
